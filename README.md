# Shell-Game-native-Javascript

### What's that ? ###

This is a little game i had to do as an exercise. 
I could update it in the futur if i find some time.

### How to try it ? ###

To run it you could use Python server web, in your terminal go into the folder of the project :
`cd ~/ShellGameNative`
Once you're inside, use :
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

And then in your favorite browser go on ` http://localhost:8080 `
